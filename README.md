Exploratory Data Analysis of Airbnb NYC dataset 
Airbnb is a online hotel booking platform.
People from neighbourhood rent their houses,apartment and vehicles for tourists to earn more income.
Dataset is divided among neighbourhood groups like Manhattan,Brooklyn,State Island.
Every neighbourhood group has a neighbour like the cities in a state.
Airbnb dataset has information related to customers who booked the hotel.
I have done analysis on the reviews and price columns of the dataset.
Availability of the hotel has impact on the price of the room.
Python libraries are used in the project to present insights to the viewer.
I would like to thank almabetter for their structured curriculumn in accomplishment of the EDA project by myself.
